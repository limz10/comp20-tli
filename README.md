# Comp 20 Web Programming
## Mingzhe Li

This is the repository for *Comp20 Spring 2015* assignments.

Among them, my favorite is the *captainslog*.  I played with jQuery and learned how to control a text input box.  The bigger assignments, the client-side and server-side map app are of course very helpful.

Before taking this class, I thought Comp 20 is quite simple, although I have no idea how to build a website by then.  At this point, I have obtained a solid idea about all the useful techniques and frameworks in web development.  I have been more confident and ready to work on solving hard problems.

The most important thing that I have learned is, I think, the development structure of a product, the difference between front-end and back-end, and how they interact.  Another thing is, one of Ming's favorites, web security.  It is really important for the developer to keep that in mind, and balancing between performance and security.

Now we have entered the era of mobile internet.  Although HTML5 has been very powerful, mobile apps still outperform in many cases.  I am looking to learn more about mobile development.
