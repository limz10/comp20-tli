The Real Marauder's Map
===

This project utilizes Google Maps API and Ming's Datastore API to display my location, my peers' locations, and their distance from me.

Everything has been implemented correctly.  There is no JavaScript errors.

I worked on this project alone.  I read Ming's example code, Google Maps API documentation, and how to use the Haversine Formula in JavaScript on StackOverflow. 

I spent approximately 3 hours on this project.
