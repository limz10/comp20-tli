I used jQuery to play with the input text box, and also time stamp in JavaScript. 

I referred to this thread on stackoverflow to wire up my custom jQuery event.  Link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6524288/jquery-event-for-user-pressing-enter-in-a-textbox

Everything has been implemented correctly.  There is no JavaScript errors.

I worked on this project alone.  I read Ming's example code, jQuery documentation, and how to use the time stamp in JavaScript. 

I spent approximately an hour on this project.
