Everything has been implemented correctly.  For Part 2: Loading the Data Given a URI, because XMLHttpRequests follow browsers' same-origin policy, the request will only pass when it was made to the same origin.  This is very practical for security reasons.  What if the JSON file Ming provided had been username-password pairs from an online banking system?  Were somebody able to read those with simple JavaScript, people's wealth would be very unsafe.

I could spend less than an hour on this assignment, but I spent a lot of time thinking and reading about some interesting problems related.
