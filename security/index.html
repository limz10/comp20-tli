    <title> Security Assessment of Marauder's Map </title>
</head>

<body>

    <h1> Introduction </h1>
    <p> This project tests the security of the Marauder's Map client-side and server-side application.  The Marauder's Map is a system where the user can check-in his/her location and view others' location on the map. </p>

    <h1> Methodology </h1>
    <p> I used simple tools like curl to look for vulnerabilities.  I also reviewed the source code to identify errors and lack of safeguard. </p>

    <h1> Abstract of Findings </h1> 

    <p> Provide an overview of all the security and privacy issues you identified. This section should be written for non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have time to read the entire document. Write this section using lay language. </p>

    <h1> Issues Found </h1> 

    <p> For each issue that you find, document:
        Issue (e.g., database injection, really bad programming practice)
        Location / page where issue was found
        Severity of issue (e.g., low, medium , or high). Justify your answer.
        Description of issue. How did you find it? A screenshot of problem is excellent.
        Proof of vulnerability. Screenshots are ideal.
        Resolution. How did you resolve the issue? Show code if possible.
    </p>
    
    <h1> Conclusion </h1> 
    <p> You can also list future considerations and recommendations with costs. </p>
